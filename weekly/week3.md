# Accomplishments

#### 1 Fixed my glasses, along with my productivity.

I went to the optic store in the UI hospital. The lady there found out that the frame of my glasses is broken, and said she might do something that temporarily fix my glasses. When I returned from the closest restroom, I found here actually got a cheap frame for me and the lens from my original glasses, so I have my glasses being fixed for free. I'm really grateful to her.

During all the time with my glasses being off, I have already formed the habit to walk on road and see everything without glasses, plus taking a very close look to my device's screen. After taking on my glasses, I believe that the first habit is good, but the second one is...

#### 2 Found enough(?) people to chat with, and potentially forming my theory towards the internet.

Nowadays, mental health could be a problem towards all the students, especially in the academia. On the other hand, although people are viewing the contents on the internet, they can never gain feelings that are long-lasting. Dating apps has been found useful to me, as I have investigated into the social logic of dating apps. 

I pick Reddit and Twitter as the representations of usual social platforms. They are actually only encouraging people to read, not encouraging people to express themselves and to know each other. Lots of people on the Twitter are broadcasting their opinions, but its not making friends. Whether this is a situation being made deliberately or not, it's happening.

Although dating apps get their names on dating, plenty of people there are actually for friends to chat with. Their social logic is quite the opposite to Reddit and Twitter, which first encourages you to express your interest, otherwise you won't make connections with others; then it encourages you to make connections with others through one-to-one chat, which is much deeper and longer than most contents on Twitter. I believe in a slogan: the real value of social platform must be *deep* chats towards *strangers*. You can do as many contents as you like, but the more you have of them, the less you have of actual socials. Dating apps has cut off the contents, in order to make better socials.

In case anyone else is seeing this note, and might have a much more serious problem with your mental health, that the academia and the society doesn't really care. I'll encourage you to get on the dating apps, which is not just for dating because there are people wanting to make friends. All these above only don't work out if, you're more an introvert than me. I had to become slightly more extrovert, all for the purpose of making myself alive mentally. At the very least, I have been feeling I'm being encouraged since 1 month ago.

#### 3 Finished reading the [tutorial](https://github.com/pepeiborra/hls-tutorial) for HLS plugin.

To get a basic sense about how to write a HLS plugin, I have finished reading the tutorial. I think the next step for me is fix the HLS issue in my container, and:

- Write out a very small, example-like plugin for the HLS.
- Focus on collecting the type errors, and try to make some dumb code lens for them.

# Obstacles

The main issue for my build of HLS seems to be the permission of the users that I have set up in the Dockerfile. I have explained them mostly in the update to the `containerized` branch of the HLS.
